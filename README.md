# HelloWorld
a learning project on git

This is my first try on the Github. I'm very interested in coding and my initiative is to take advantage of coding methods to improve working effeciency and even make the changes of our life. Now I'm a fresher in coding and hope to learn more.

Learning by doing! It makes sense. LOL.
